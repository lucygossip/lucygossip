<h3>No Matter Where You Are</h3>
<p>‘No Matter Where You Are’ is a composition for choir and piano. It is inspired by the book ‘Dear John’ by Nicholas Sparks. This piece was created early on in the coronavirus lockdown. It was written partly as a reminder that we are all still connected; but more importantly, it enables the choir to put its voices together even during a time when we’re forced to sing in isolation.</p>
<p>The lyrics are based around quotes from the novel:</p>
<p><i>‘No matter where you are in the world, the moon is never bigger than your thumb.’</i></p>
<p><i>‘It’s a full moon here tonight, which makes me think of you. Because I know…no matter what I am doing, or where I am, this moon will always be the same size as yours, half a world away.’</i></p>
